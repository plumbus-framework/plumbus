# Changelog

## 0.2.2 — Unreleased

- Document core 0.7.4+ classification with per-call provider/model and probability threshold. Link the packaged classification recipe from agent instructions and correct stale package-only guidance. Core peer compatibility remains `0.7.x`.

- Preserve model, usage, and known TypeSafe cost on malformed-answer errors so core 0.7.3 records billed failures. Keep unknown response models unpriced.
- Document native core registration and cost recording; existing core peer ranges remain unchanged.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-23

- Initial optional TypeSafe/Jev System One HTTP adapter for typed choices, scores, and probabilities, using `@plumbus/ai-decision` contracts and validation.
- Validate credentials/endpoints, normalize native answers, and handle bounded retries, cancellation, deadlines, and malformed responses with structured errors.
- Price the actual response model using bundled or configured input rates; return unknown cost explicitly and retain usage when pricing fails.
- Ship offline unit and HTTP tests, consumer agent instructions, and smoke tooling. Both decision adapters can be exercised against the local Laya reference service; this does not verify hosted TypeSafe authentication or billing.
- Requires core `0.7.x`. Core `ctx.ai.decide()`, provider registration, automatic budgets/auditing, and agent discovery remain deferred.
